# PV/ESS Simulator

This project aims to simulate photovoltaic generation with different inverters, as well as integrating storage systems (battery, also known as ESS). A cost benefit analysis will be implemented to check how much more financially viable selecting a better inverter would be.

Project is being developed for ExaWatt in fulfillment of MSc Dissertation requirements.

# Current features

  - Integration with Renewables Ninja API to pull PV generation datasets.
  - Integration with inverter efficiency curves to calculate losses.

### Todos

 - Work on integrating cost-benefit analysis
 - Integrate ESS system
